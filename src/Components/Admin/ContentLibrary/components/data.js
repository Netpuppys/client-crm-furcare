export const abscess = `<h2>Abscess</h2><p><br></p><p>An abscess is a pocket of infected material, or pus, consisting of bacteria or other organisms, as well as red and white blood cells. This type of infection has many causes. Often, a bite or other penetrating wound carries bacteria into the tissues. Infection builds at the site, which produces pus. If the pus has no place to drain out of the body, an abscess forms under the skin or in deeper tissues, causing significant damage and endangering the pet.</p><p><br></p><p>Common signs of an abscess include a painful area, swelling, or mass with bruising and foul-smelling discharge at the site. The pet may become depressed, feverish, painful or reluctant to move. Decreased appetite or water intake may occur as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Abscesses are diagnosed using symptoms, examination findings, history, blood testing, and sometimes x-rays. Treatment depends on the severity of the abscess. Antibiotics are needed to control infection. Many abscesses require surgical removal of infected tissue and drainage. Often a surgical drain will need to be left in place for a few days. Good wound care and cleaning are essential to speed up the healing process.</p><p><br></p><p>*** IMPORTANT POINTS IN TREATMENT ***</p><p><br></p><p>Please use all medications as prescribed.</p><p><br></p><p>Follow all wound care instructions.</p><p><br></p><p>Keep your pet indoors or in a confined area during the treatment period.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not allow any chewing, licking or scratching at surgical drains or stitches.</p><p><br></p><p>An Elizabethan (cone shaped) collar will probably be required.</p><p><br></p><p>Monitor your pet carefully and have him/her rechecked as recommended by your veterinarian.</p><p><br></p><p>Please contact the medical team if you have any questions.</p>`

export const allergicReaction = `<h2>Allergic Reaction</h2><p><br></p><p>The immune system is designed to protect the body from infection. A normal functioning system recognizes things that are "non-self" such as bacteria, viruses, other microorganisms, pollen, and other small particles that enter or contact the body. The immune system processes the invaders to help prevent disease. In some instances, the immune system can overreact, causing mild to severe, life-threatening disease, manifesting as an "allergic reaction." Almost any substance can potentially cause an allergic reaction including food, insect bites, medications, grooming products, vaccines, and inhaled particles like dust or pollen.</p><p><br></p><p>Mild to moderate reactions may include swelling or irritation of the skin, especially around the face, head, and feet. Hives, rashes, blisters, clear discharge from eyes or nostrils, sneezing, itching, and mild discomfort may also be present. More serious reactions include all of the above as well as difficulty breathing, choking, coughing, severe swelling or skin reactions, pain, depression, and anaphylactic shock (this is a severe, immediate, and life-threatening immune reaction that requires emergency treatment).</p><p><br></p><p>Diagnosis is based on history, symptoms, and examination findings. All allergic reactions should receive prompt medical treatment. The treatment varies based on severity but usually includes antihistamines and other medications to control the allergic reaction. Severe cases may require additional medications, breathing support, cardiac monitoring, fluid therapy, and hospitalization.</p><p><br></p><p>*** IMPORTANT POINTS IN TREATMENT ***</p><p><br></p><p>Please use all medications as prescribed.</p><p><br></p><p>Monitor your pet's progress carefully and have him/her rechecked if there are any concerns.</p><p><br></p><p>Have your pet rechecked as recommended by your veterinarian.</p><p><br></p><p>Please call the medical team if you have any questions.</p>`

export const analSacDisease = `<h2>Anal Sac (Gland) Disease</h2><p><br></p><p>Dogs and cats have two glands located just inside the anal opening called anal sacs, or anal glands. The glands are normal structures that produce fluid with an unpleasant odor. These sacs can become infected, inflamed, or cancerous. In some Pets, full sacs may cause irritation that manifests itself as scooting, licking or chewing at the area. Having the sacs emptied by trained personnel can usually relieve the discomfort if the glands are otherwise normal.</p><p><br></p><p>Sacs that are irritated or not able to empty well may become clogged (impacted) which can lead to an anal gland abscess. Abscesses are usually very painful, swollen, and may drain. Cancer can also arise in the glands, producing a swollen or ulcerated mass near the anus.</p><p><br></p><p>Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and physical examination. Laboratory testing may also be necessary. Treatment varies with the type and severity of the disease. Infected or inflamed glands will require antibiotics. Abscesses may require surgical drainage and wound care at home in addition to antibiotics. Sacs that cause recurrent problems or become cancerous may need to be surgically removed.</p><p><br></p><p>*** IMPORTANT POINTS IN TREATMENT ***</p><p><br></p><p>Your pet's anal sacs may need to be expressed frequently.</p><p><br></p><p>Please use all medications as prescribed.</p><p><br></p><p>Monitor your pet's progress carefully and have him/her rechecked if there are any concerns.</p><p><br></p><p>Have your pet rechecked as recommended by your veterinarian.</p><p><br></p><p>Please call the medical team if you have any questions.</p>`

export const atopy = `<h2>Atopy / Food Related Allergic Skin Disease</h2><p><br></p><p>Atopy and food related allergic skin disease are caused by reactions to be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed "allergens" (pollen, mold spores, dust, dust mites, food, etc.). This is similar to "hay fever" in humans. However, instead of the sinus and nasal signs in humans, pets may manifest the disease as skin irritation that can include the entire skin surface and ear canals.</p><p><br></p><p>Allergic pets may constantly scratch and bite at the skin. Some may chew or lick themselves until wounds form. Other signs include rubbing, redness of the skin (especially on face and feet), ear infections or inflammation, and hair loss. Thickened or darkened skin may develop under the armpits, on the abdomen, inside the earflaps, or around the anus. The irritated skin can easily become infected by bacteria or yeast which already exist on normal skin.</p><p><br></p><p>These types of allergies are often diagnosed by a combination of symptoms, examination findings, history, and response to treatment. Specialized allergy testing may help reveal what is causing the reaction and allow for "hyposensitization," or individualized allergy medication, that can be helpful in treatment. Numerous medications, special diets, and topical skin treatments are available to reduce symptoms and discomfort.</p><p><br></p><p>Allergic skin disease can be difficult and frustrating to treat.

Vaccination should also help protect your pet's lungs from long term damage due to secondary infections (pneumonia) and inflammation.</p><p><br></p><p>Depending on the strain of canine influenza, other pets (cats, ferrets, etc) may potentially be at risk for contracting influenza from an infected dog.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have any questions about canine influenza or the vaccination, please contact your {Hospital Name}.</p><p><br></p><p>References and suggested reading:</p>`

export const canineParvoVirus = `<h2>Canine Parvo Virus</h2><p><br></p><p>Parvovirus usually attacks the stomach and intestines. Occasionally, it can infect heart tissue as well, causing sudden death. Young, unvaccinated or partially vaccinated dogs and puppies are at greatest risk. However, any dog can become infected with the disease. On rare occasions, a completely vaccinated pet can contract Parvo if his or her immune system has not responded properly to vaccination.</p><p><br></p><p>The virus is shed in a stool and can remain infectious in contaminated areas for months, even though freezing temperatures. It can be transmitted from dog to dog through stool, from contaminated areas, and even on clothing or shoes.</p><p><br></p><p>The hallmarks of Parvo are vomiting and diarrhea. Depression, fever, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, decreased water intake, weakness, weight loss, and other abnormalities can accompany the infection. Severe and/or bloody diarrhea or vomiting can easily lead to fatal dehydration, blood loss and intestinal damage. Damaged intestines can leak deadly bacterial toxins into the body. This disease requires immediate and thorough treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>Diagnosis is based on symptoms, examination findings, stool and blood tests, and response to treatment. X-rays are sometimes necessary. Treatment depends on the type, severity, and duration of the disease. Antibiotics, dewormers, intestinal medications, fluid and electrolyte therapy, and special diets are needed as appropriate. Many pets require intensive intravenous treatments and may remain hospitalized for days. Even with the best possible care, some critically ill patients still die. Good nursing care is essential to recovery.</p><p><br></p><p>*** IMPORTANT POINTS IN TREATMENT***</p><p><br></p><p>Please use all medications as prescribed.</p><p><br></p><p>Monitor your pet's progress carefully and have him/her rechecked if there are any concerns.</p><p><br></p><p>Separate any ill pets from others and use separate feeding, bedding, and grooming items.

Injury, infections, toxins, congenital or inherited abnormalities, and several diseases (including diabetes) can cause cataract formation as well. Cataracts can range from small, faint spots to total and profound clouding of the entire lens. Cataracts (especially when age related) often become progressively worse over time. In severe cases, little or no light can pass to the back of the eye, resulting in blindness.</p><p><br></p><p>Diagnosis is based examination findings that include a clouded appearance or "milky" flecks or lines in the normally clear eye lens. A complete eye examination is important to access the lens and health of the eye and its surrounding tissues. Laboratory tests may be necessary to check for underlying infection or disease.</p><p><br></p><p>Surgical removal is the only reliable treatment for serious cataract formation. Any underlying problems such as injury, infection, or systemic disease must also be addressed. Surgery is considered in cases where the rest of the eye is normal, no serious underlying disease is present, and the possibility to restore adequate sight is high. Some owners choose not to pursue cataract surgery. If cared for properly, a visually impaired pet can remain an active part of the family and have a good quality of life.</p><p><br></p><p>*** IMPORTANT POINTS IN CARE***</p><p><br></p><p>Please use all medications as prescribed.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel free to discuss prognosis and treatment options with your veterinarian.</p><p><br></p><p>Monitor your pet's eyes and overall health carefully.

The mite can be present in small numbers on healthy pets without causing a problem. For several reasons, often including immune system suppression, individual pets may develop symptoms of mange that include hair loss, skin redness or swelling, and occasionally itching, crusting, and secondary bacterial infection in the affected area(s). Demodectic mange often appears around the eyes, over the top of the skull, or on the feet. Demodectic mange is not considered to be contagious under normal circumstances.</p><p><br></p><p>Mange is diagnosed by a combination of symptoms, examination findings, and laboratory testing. An important skin test, a "skin scraping," is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Mites can be observed microscopically in the test sample. There are several treatment options. Mitaban is an FDA-approved product for the treatment of demodectic mange. It is highly effective in most cases. Side effects or reactions to Mitaban treatment are possible. Be sure to consult the medical team if you suspect one. Several other treatments are also available. Weeks or months of treatment are usually required to control mange.</p><p><br></p><p>A small percentage of dogs may relapse and require repeated treatments.

export const dentalTartar = `<h2>Dental Tartar, Gingivitis, Periodontal Disease</h2><p><br></p><p>Dental calculus is composed of various mineral salts, organic material, bacteria, saliva, and food particles. In the early stages of accumulation, the material is soft and is termed dental plaque. Plaque can be removed by brushing daily. As time passes, the plaque becomes hardened and adheres to the teeth. At this point, the plaque becomes a dental calculus. Calculus (plural, calculi) builds up above and below the gum line. Calculus is visible as a yellow to brown material on the tooth surface, usually near the gum, and cannot be removed by brushing.</p><p><br></p><p>Gingivitis is the result of continual accumulation of dental calculi, causing pressure, inflammation, and infection of the gums (also called gingival tissue, or the gingival line). Gingival tissue may appear swollen, reddened, and may be painful. At this stage, there is no loss of any underlying supportive structures of the teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>Periodontal disease is the result of progressive gingivitis and represents damage to or loss of the tissues that help support the teeth. These tissues include the gingiva, ligaments, and underlying bone. Radiographs (x-rays) may be necessary to determine the extent of the underlying disease. There are 4 stages of periodontal disease, with stage 4 being the most severe. Refer to the Dental Care Client Brochure for more details.</p><p><br></p><p>It is currently known that some of the internal diseases of dogs and cats may be caused by diseased teeth and gums. Bacteria can travel through the blood stream to vital organs like the heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys and cause damage. The American Veterinary Dental College recommends an annual veterinary dental cleaning, along with daily home care. Good home dental care, including tooth brushing, can reduce the formation of dental calculus and help slow the progression of periodontal disease.</p><p><br></p><p>Treats that help control the development of dental calculus, specific diets for dental health, and certain chew toys can also be helpful. Look for the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) seal on dental products.

Glucose is the body's fuel and is required for life. Normally, insulin allows the body to absorb and use glucose derived from food. Insulin is a hormone produced by special cells in the pancreas. Diabetics often need to receive supplemental insulin in the form of injections to properly absorb and utilize glucose.</p><p><br></p><p>Diagnosis is based on symptoms, examination findings, and blood tests. Treatment usually involves insulin injections, special food, and strict feeding schedules. Without insulin replacement, more serious changes occur within the body that can lead to blindness, liver failure, diabetic coma and death.

Apply an appropriate cleaning solution into the ear canal opening. Inappropriate liquids can cause irritation and damage to the delicate ear structures. Your pet's doctor will likely prescribe an ear cleaner designed for use in pets. Use almost enough cleaner to fill up the canal. Some of the cleaning solution can be gently rubbed on the earflap if needed.</li><li>Gently massage the ear at its base. You should hear the cleaner "squish" in the ear as you massage. Continue for 30-90 seconds. Then, wipe up excess solution and loose debris from the earflap and ear canal entrance with a dry cotton ball or paper towel. You may also allow your pet to shake its head to bring up more solution and debris from the canals. Gently wipe this away with a cotton ball. You might want to perform ear cleaning in the backyard or garage as debris and cleaner may be shaken out of your pet's ears onto surrounding surfaces. The goal of ear cleaning is to remove the debris deep in the ear canal. This allows ear medications to work more effectively.</li><li>Repeat the cleaning procedure as directed by your pet's doctor. Any ear medications should be placed in the ear after cleaning, not before. It is usually best to wait 20-30 minutes between ear cleaning and application of medication.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Medication Application:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Gently grasp the ear tip and pull it straight up and slightly away from the pet's head (toward you). Apply the prescribed amount of medication into the ear canal opening, allowing it to run down into the canal.</li><li>After placing medication in the ear, massage gently as directed above for the cleaning procedure. If only a small amount of medication is used, you may not hear a "squish" as you would during cleaning.</li><li>If the inner ear flap is involved, place a small amount (about 1/3 of the prescribed amount of medication) on the earflap. Spread the medication over the affected area (ideally with a gloved finger or a cotton ball). The entire affected should be covered with a thin film of medication.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Bathing During Treatment:</p><p><br></p><p>If your pet needs bathing during the ear treatment period, plug the opening of the ear canals with dry cotton balls to prevent water from running into the canals.</p><p><br></p><p>Rechecks:</p><p><br></p><p>Be sure to have your pet rechecked as directed by your veterinarian.

export const giardia = `<h2>Giardia</h2><p><br></p><p>Giardia is a microscopic parasite that can infect most mammals, including humans. The parasite invades cells lining the intestinal tract, causing bowel irritation and damage. There, the parasites reproduce and shed into the stool to pass out of the body. This stage of the parasite is very hearty and can remain infective in the environment for long periods of time. Infection occurs when parasites are ingested in contaminated water, stool, plant material, or food. Even licking a few drops of contaminated water, or a few parasites off of the paws or coat, can potentially cause infection.</p><p><br></p><p>Pets infected with Giardia may or may not show obvious symptoms. Pets that do not appear ill can still shed the parasite in their stool, acting as a source of infection for other pets or human family members. Common problems seen during infection may include decreased energy, weight loss, vomiting, or diarrhea. Diagnosis can be difficult. Multiple microscopic stool examinations or other laboratory tests are usually necessary. Several medications exist to treat infection. Often, more than one course of therapy is needed to eliminate Giardia.</p><p><br></p><p>*** IMPORTANT POINTS IN TREATMENT ***</p><p><br></p><p>All infected pets in the household should be treated.</p><p><br></p><p>All stools should be cleaned up at least once daily during the treatment period and regularly thereafter.</p><p><br></p><p>Kennels and dog runs should be disinfected with a diluted bleach solution and rinsed well, daily, during the treatment period.</p><p><br></p><p>One or more stool samples should be examined after treatment to be sure your pet is parasite free.</p><p><br></p><p>Please contact your hospital with any questions.</p>`

export const heatwormDisease = `<h2>Heartworm Disease &amp; Prevention</h2><p><br></p><p>A mosquito-borne parasite called Dirofilaria immitis causes canine heartworm disease. When an infected mosquito bites a pet, microscopic heartworm larvae can enter the skin and tissues. The larvae migrate in multiple body tissues until they reach the large vessels of the heart and lungs. These parasites then grow up to 12 inches long in the heart and surrounding blood vessels. Heartworm disease can cause heart, lung, kidney, and liver damage. Luckily, this is a preventable disease. Dogs are at most risk for heartworm infection. However, cats, ferrets, wild canines (foxes, etc.), humans, and several other mammals can be infected.</p><p><br></p><p>Often, infected pets may show no symptoms until severe tissue damage has already occurred. These signs include coughing, respiratory problems, lack of energy, exercise intolerance, weight loss, fainting, coughing up blood, or sudden respiratory distress and death. Diagnosis is based on signs, history, blood and other laboratory tests, and sometimes X-rays. Treatment usually consists of medications to kill the adult parasites first and later the larval stages. In some cases, pets may have serious or potentially fatal reactions to treatment medications. Also, the dead or dying adult worms may flow into the lungs, causing life threatening blood vessel blockages.</p><p><br></p><p>Prevention is the best, easiest, safest, and least expensive medicine. After testing to rule out a pre-existing infection, heartworm preventative will keep pet's parasite free which may be a monthly oral medication, or an injection given by your veterinarian that lasts 6 months. Many heartworm preventives also kill some intestinal worms that can cause serious disease.</p><p><br></p><p>*** IMPORTANT POINTS IN PREVENTION and TREATMENT ***</p><p><br></p><p>Have your pet checked for heartworm disease yearly.</p><p><br></p><p>Use heartworm preventives or other medications as directed by your veterinarian.</p><p><br></p><p>If your pet has been diagnosed with heartworm disease, be sure to discuss treatment and prognosis with your veterinarian immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>Monitor your pet carefully and have him/her rechecked as directed by your veterinarian.</p><p><br></p><p>Please contact your hospital with any questions.</p>`

The normal hip is a ball and socket type joint. The socket is part of the pelvis. The ball is at the upper end, or head, of the femur (thigh) bone. With dysplasia, the normally rounded head of the femur is flattened and fits poorly into the socket and/or the socket may be abnormally shallow.</p><p><br></p><p>Common signs include hind leg lameness, swaying or staggering, discomfort upon rising, and reluctance to run and jump. Excess body weight or concurrent injuries can worsen existing hip dysplasia. The disease ranges from mild and only slightly uncomfortable, to severe and chronically painful. Cases of extensive disease can cause progressive, crippling arthritis.</p><p><br></p><p>Diagnosis is based on symptoms, examination findings and X-rays. Treatment is based on the severity of the disease. Maintenance of proper body weight is important for all dysplastic pets. Weight control and anti-inflammatory medications may be adequate for mild to moderate cases. A modified exercise plan may be helpful as well. Serious cases can require surgery.

The entire uterus may fill with pus. Spayed females do not develop this form of the disease. Very rarely, a spayed female can develop an infection of the small amount of uterine tissue that can sometimes remain after a spay surgery (stump pyometra).</p><p><br></p><p>Signs include loss of appetite, excessive thirst, vomiting, vulvar discharge or swelling of the vulva, and abdominal discomfort. The disease can develop slowly over an extended period before the illness becomes apparent. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, examination findings, blood or other tests, and x-rays. Treatment usually requires extensive therapy and surgical removal of the uterus.</p><p><br></p><p>*** IMPORTANT POINTS IN TREATMENT and PREVENTION ***</p><p><br></p><p>Spayed females do not develop this form of the disease.</p><p><br></p><p>It is important to follow any aftercare or post-surgical instructions.</p><p><br></p><p>Please use all medications as prescribed.</p><p><br></p><p>Monitor your pet's progress carefully and have her rechecked as directed by your veterinarian.</p><p><br></p><p>Please contact your hospital with any questions.</p>`

Please note that a negative result on a fecal examination does not completely rule out a parasitic infection, due to variations in parasite life cycles. It is recommended to administer a general deworming medication, like Pyrantel, every 6 months, even if a recent fecal examination was negative.</p><p><br></p><p>YOUR PET SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN PYRANTEL IF HE/SHE HAS A KNOWN SENSITIVITY / ALLERGY TO THIS MEDICATION OR RELATED COMPOUNDS.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW AND WHEN DO I GIVE THE MEDICINE TO MY PET?</p><p><br></p><p>Always follow the doctor’s directions.

export const ringworms = `<h2>Ringworms (Dermatophytosis)</h2><p><br></p><p>"Ringworm" is the common name for several types of fungi that can infect the skin of pets and people. These organisms can be found in the soil, on animals, or on humans. Pets may acquire a fungal infection from any of these sources and, in turn, pass the infection along to others. Fungal spores can remain a source of infection in the environment for many months. The skin lesions caused by this infection are often circular with a red outer edge, leading to the name "ringworm." However, a worm is not responsible. Hair loss and skin crusting may accompany infection.</p><p><br></p><p>Diagnosis is based on symptoms, examination findings, and laboratory tests. Special skin testing is required to confirm a diagnosis of "ringworm." Treatment varies depending on the extent and severity of infection. Topical medications or medicated shampoos are effective in many cases. Oral antifungal medications may also be necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>*** IMPORTANT POINTS IN TREATMENT ***</p><p><br></p><p>Please use all medications and skin treatments as prescribed.</p><p><br></p><p>Monitor your pet's progress carefully and have him/her rechecked as directed by your veterinarian.</p><p><br></p><p>Clean all pet bedding, clothing, and grooming materials.</p><p><br></p><p>Up to six weeks of treatment may be required to resolve some cases of "Ringworm."</p><p><br></p><p>Some types of "Ringworm" are contagious to humans.</p><p><br></p><p>Please contact your hospital with any questions.</p>`

export const sarcopticMange = `<h2><strong>Sarcoptic Mange<span class="ql-cursor">﻿</span></strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Sarcoptic mange (scabies) is caused by a microscopic insect, a mite, which infects dogs, cats, and other mammals, including people. The insect burrows under the skin causing very intense itching. Pets are often so itchy they may chew, rub, or lick their skin until open wounds develop. Symptoms include intense and constant itching, self-mutilation from chewing and scratching, hair loss, skin redness or swelling, crusting, and secondary bacterial infection in the affected area(s). The infection can occur anywhere on the body, especially elbows, ear tips, face, hocks, and chest.</p><p><br></p><p>Diagnosis is attempted by a combination of symptoms, examination findings, and laboratory testing. An important skin test, a "skin scraping," can sometimes detect the parasite microscopically. However, this type of mange can be very difficult to confirm by laboratory testing. Often, suspected cases are treated even if no mites can be found under the microscope. There are several treatment options including medicated dips and injections. Rare side effects or reactions to treatment are possible and some can be breed specific. Be sure to consult the medical team. Multiple treatments are usually required to control mange.</p><p><br></p><p>*** IMPORTANT POINTS IN TREATMENT ***</p><p><br></p><p>Complete all prescribed medications.</p><p><br></p><p>Additional skin scrapings may be needed to confirm that the mites are gone.</p><p><br></p><p>It is important to monitor your pet's progress carefully and have him/her rechecked as recommended by your veterinarian.</p><p><br></p><p>Please contact your hospital with any questions.</p>`

export const skinMasses = `<h2><strong>Skin Masses</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Skin masses can arise for a very large number of reasons including infections, tumors, parasites, injury, cysts (clogged or inflamed glands), warts, and calluses. Masses can range in size from pinpoint to many inches in diameter. It can often be difficult to determine the underlying cause without skin or lab tests.</p><p><br></p><p>True tumors (cancer) can be benign, aggressive and life threatening. Sometimes a "tumor" may really turn out to be a wart, a callus, a cyst, or an inflamed area of skin. All skin masses should be evaluated by a veterinarian, especially those that grow, change, become painful, ulcerated, or infected.</p><p><br></p><p>Diagnosis is based on symptoms, examination findings, and skin or lab tests that may include taking a sample of the mass for microscopic analysis. Not all masses will require treatment. If needed, treatment can vary widely based on the type and size of the mass. If the mass is suspicious, immediate removal and microscopic testing may be recommended. All questionable masses should be addressed as soon as possible. Sometimes, the early removal of a cancerous mass can prevent the spread of cancer to other places in the body.</p><p><br></p><p>*** IMPORTANT POINTS IN TREATMENT ***</p><p><br></p><p>Please use all medications as prescribed.</p><p><br></p><p>Monitor your pet's progress carefully and have him or her rechecked if there are any concerns.</p><p><br></p><p>Have your pet rechecked as recommended by your veterinarian.</p><p><br></p><p>Please call the medical team if you have any questions.</p><p><br></p><p>Please contact your hospital with any questions.</p>`

export const umbilicalHernia = `<h2><strong>Umbilical Hernia</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>An umbilical hernia occurs when the abdominal muscles fail to grow together and properly close the abdominal opening where the naval cord was attached at birth. The hernia usually appears as a soft swelling at the "umbilicus" or belly button.</p><p><br></p><p>Your veterinarian should evaluate all hernias. Mild hernias will contain a small amount of abdominal fat. If the hernia is large enough to allow a loop of the intestine to become entrapped within it, strangulation of the intestine may occur. This is an emergency situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Diagnosis is based on symptoms and examination findings. Hernias should be repaired when the pet is spayed or neutered unless the defect is large enough to warrant immediate repair. Spaying or neutering of pets with umbilical hernias is recommended due to the potential for hereditary predisposition.</p><p><br></p><p>*** IMPORTANT POINTS IN TREATMENT ***</p><p><br></p><p>Please follow all post-surgical instructions.</p><p><br></p><p>Monitor your pet's progress carefully and have him/her rechecked as directed by your veterinarian.</p><p><br></p><p>Please contact your hospital with any questions.</p>`
